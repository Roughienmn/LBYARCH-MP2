# x86-to-C Interface Programming Project
This project was made to compare the performance of two kernel versions, implemented in C and x86-64 Assembly. The performance is measured in terms of execution time, and are executed in both Debug and Release Configurations of Visual Studio 2022.

## Specifications
The project comprises of 2 kernel versions (C and x86-64), and both are to simulate the DAXPY (AX + Y) function. 

**Input:**
- Scalar variable **_n_** (integer) contains the length of the vectors X, Y, and Z
  - For the analysis, n will have possible values of **2^20, 2^24, 2^28** and **2^30**
- Scalar variable **_A_** is a double-precision float value (set to **2.00** for the analysis)
- Vectors **_X, Y,_** and **_Z_** are double-precision floats of length n
  - For the analysis, **_X and Y_** are initialized with random double-precision float values
  
**Process:** **Z[i] = A â€¢ X[i] + Y[i]**  
Performs the DAXPY function (**D**ouble precision **AX** **P**lus **Y**) on the given inputs.

**Output:**  
Store the result in vector **_Z_**. Display the result of the first 10 elements of vector Z for all kernel versions (C and x86-64).
